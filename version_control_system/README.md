## Version Control System LLD Functionalities
###   Repository Management

-     init: Initialize a new repository

-     Repository metadata storage (name, paths)

-     .vcs directory structure creation

###   File Tracking

-     File snapshot creation with content hashing (SHA-1)

-     Staging area management (add/remove files)

-     Working directory state detection

###   Commit System

-     Atomic commit creation

-     Commit metadata (message, timestamp, author)

-     Parent commit references for history

-     Content-addressable storage (commit hashes)

###   Branching System

-     Branch creation (create_branch)

-     Branch switching (checkout)

-     Lightweight branch pointers

-     HEAD reference management

###   Merging

-     Three-way merge implementation

## Advanced Features Implemented
###   Data Integrity

-     Cryptographic hashing (SHA-1) for:

-     Invalid operations

-     Graceful failure modes

###   Persistence

-     Commit object storage

-     Branch reference storage

-     File version snapshots

## Safety & Performance Features
###   Thread Safety

-     Borrow checker-enforced exclusive access

-     No concurrent modification risks

###   Memory Safety

-     Ownership-based resource management

-     No dangling references

###   Efficiency
